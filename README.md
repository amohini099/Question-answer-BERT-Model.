# Question-answer-BERT-Model.
1. This Project is based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which is a popular natural language processing model that has been used for a wide range of tasks, including question answering. A question answering system using BERT involves training a BERT model to take a question as input and generate an answer as output.
2. The training process involves feeding the model a large number of question-answer pairs and adjusting the model's internal parameters to minimize the error between the model's output and the correct answer.you can use it to answer new questions by inputting the question and obtaining the answer from the model's output. The model can be fine-tuned for specific domains or types of questions to improve its performance.
